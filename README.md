# Eos Experimentation
Minimal implementations of the circles protocol as EOS smart contracts.

## Why EOS
There are a couple of reasons EOS is interesting as a platform for Circles:
* High and cheap throughput
* Extremely fast transaction finality
* Foundation to build upon (in contrast with building a standalone blockchain)

## Disclaimer
CirclesUBI is also being implemented on other platforms like ethereum. As the actual platform is not yet determined, this repository is nothing more then a sandbox for research.
